## Getting Started

1. **Open `Main.html`** in your web browser to use the BloodBridge frontend.
2. The interface allows you to:
   - Submit emergency blood requests.
   - View and schedule blood donations.
   - Update blood bank inventory.

> **Note:**  
> The current frontend is static and uses alert dialogs for feedback. API integration points are marked in the JavaScript for future backend connectivity.

## Customization

- To update upcoming blood drives, edit the `<ul>` in the Donor Management section of `Main.html`.
- To change form validation or add new fields, modify the relevant `<form>` elements and JavaScript functions.
